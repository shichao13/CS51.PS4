(*
 * Write a signature called LIST that only exposes the functions length,
 * fold_right, and rev. The Core.Std.List documentation might be helpful:

(* Write a signature TF that exposes as much of *both* Ben

(* The follow should work after you define the TF signature *)
(*
module TFBen = (Ben : TF)
module TFRob = (Rob : TF)

(*>* Problem 1.3 *>*)

(* Challenge (worth 1 point)!

 * Write another module that matches sig TF. Try to fill
 * in the info of your own TF! If you don't have a TF, or
 * your TF is already listed here, then feel free to
 * create a module for Henry, Jesse, or yourself.
 *
 * You should not trivially reuse any of the same values as
 * were used above in order to implement the module.
